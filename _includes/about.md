### Welcome!

My name is Christian Clinton. I'm a Linux Systems Enginner at Blizzard Entertainment. I help support all of Blizzard's customer facing servers along with my top-tier coworkers. 

My current focus is on building out Blizzard's OpenStack infrastrucutre. But, I've done a little bit of everything -- from being a Windows administrator to being web developer. I'll get to posting content on here soon&trade;, but for now, check out my profile links below to learn more about what I do.
