### Welcome!

My name is Christian Clinton. I'm a Linux Systems Enginner at Blizzard Entertainment. I help support all of Blizzard's customer facing servers with my top-tier coworkers. 

My current focus is on building Blizzard's OpenStack infrastrucutre. But, I've done a little bit of everything -- from Windows administration to web development. Check out my profile links to see more about what I do.
